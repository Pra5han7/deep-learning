these programs are created using python without using any deep learning
libraries.

	simple_CatVsNonCat_classification.py
	------------------------------------
		data_prep.py--> prepares image data to feed to the 
				model. various steps and data created
				from the program is mentioned in the
				code file.

		model.py -->	this is the main program which does the
				classification using logistic regression
				steps taken are:
				getting input
				initialize weights and biases
				initialize an activation function(sigmoid)
				implement propagation(forward and back)
				implement optimizer to minimize cost of params
				predict method to measure accuracy.
		at the end program ask to feed in a picture which it will classify
		as either a cat or non cat.
	
	this model works extremely well on training data and extremely poor on test
	which is due to small training size and only one layer in the network. I will
	be working to enhance it using regularization and adding more layers to the network
	also by deploying other means of classification techniques.
